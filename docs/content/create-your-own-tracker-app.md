## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how you can create your own Tracker app in a browser using Mendix Studio. The Tracker app can be used for keeping track of everything from
office supplies to warehouse stock.

This how-to assumes the following use case:

* You want to keep a track of parts that you use in your workshop to repair and maintain customer bikes 
* You have a warehouse where you keep the parts in a specific location allocated for each part
* You want to add a new part and edit the part details
* You want to control the stock

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a Tracker app using an app template and start editing in Mendix Studio (see section [3](https://github.com/RaviBasagonda/mendix/blob/main/docs/content/create-your-own-tracker-app.md#3-creating-a-tracker-app-and-editing-in-mendix-studio))
* Create and configure an action card on the home page to open the parts list
* Create and configure a page to display the parts list with part attributes
* Create a new entity and add part attributes such as part name, code, stock, location, etc. This entity with part attributes acts as a data source for the pages you create.
