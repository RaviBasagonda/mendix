## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how you can create your own Tracker app in a browser using Mendix Studio. The Tracker app can be used for keeping track of everything from
office supplies to warehouse stock.

This how-to assumes the following use case:

* You want to keep a track of parts that you use in your workshop to repair and maintain customer bikes 
* You have a warehouse where you keep the parts in a specific location allocated for each part
* You want to add a new part and edit the part details
* You want to control the stock

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a Tracker app and start editing in Mendix Studio (see section [3](https://github.com/RaviBasagonda/mendix/blob/main/docs/content/create-your-own-tracker-app.md#3-creating-a-tracker-app-and-editing-in-mendix-studio))
* Configure an action card and create a new page for displaying the parts list (see section [4](https://github.com/RaviBasagonda/mendix/blob/main/docs/content/create-your-own-tracker-app.md#4-configuring-an-action-card-and-creating-a-new-page-for-parts-list))
* Configure the new page
* Create a new entity and add part attributes. This entity with part attributes acts as a data source for the new page you create.
* Create and configure buttons, pages, and microflows to add a new part, edit stock, and delete a part from the parts list
* Create functionalities such as search, sort, and filter for better user experience
* Publish the Tracker app
